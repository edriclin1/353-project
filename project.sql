< The INSERT statements that populate the tables>
Important: Keep the number of rows in each table small enough so that the results of your
queries can be verified by hand. See the Sailors database as an example.
SET FEEDBACK ON
COMMIT;
--
< One query (per table) of the form: SELECT * FROM table; in order to print out your
database >
--
< The SQL queries>. Include the following for each query:
1. A comment line stating the query number and the feature(s) it demonstrates
(e.g. – Q25 – correlated subquery).
2. A comment line stating the query in English.
3. The SQL code for the query.
--
< The insert/delete/update statements to test the enforcement of ICs >
Include the following items for every IC that you test (Important: see the next section titled
“Submit a final report” regarding which ICs to test).
? A comment line stating: Testing: < IC name>
? A SQL INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE that will test the IC.
